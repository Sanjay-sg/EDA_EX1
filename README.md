## Installation of Data Analysis and Visualization Tools
### AIM:
~~~
To install and configure data analysis and visualization tools such as Python (with Jupyter
Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib), R (with RStudio, ggplot2, dplyr), Tableau Public, and
Power BI, to prepare for performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
~~~
### EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:
~~~
● Laptop/PC with internet access
● Operating System: Windows 10 or above / Ubuntu / macOS
● Admin privileges to install software
● Web browser (Chrome/Firefox/Edge)
~~~
### THEORY:
~~~
Exploratory Data Analysis requires efficient tools to clean, manipulate, and visualize data.
● Python: Versatile programming language, with libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib
for data handling and plotting.
● R: Statistical programming language, widely used in academia and research with
visualization tools like ggplot2.
● Tableau Public: Interactive visualization tool with dashboard support.
● Power BI: Business intelligence tool for data visualization and report generation.
~~~
### ALGORITHM:
~~~
A. Installing Python (Anaconda Distribution)
1. Go to https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution.
2. Download the installer based on your operating system.
3. Run the installer with default settings (recommended).
4. Open Anaconda Navigator → Launch Jupyter Notebook.
5. Create a new notebook and run the code.
~~~
### PROGRAM:
~~~
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
print("Python tools are working fine.")
#PYTHON INSTALLATION TEST
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
print("Pandas version:", pd.__version__)
print("Numpy version:", np.__version__)
print("Matplotlib version:", plt.__version__)
print("Hello, Python is successfully installed!")
~~~
### B. Installing R and RStudio
~~~
1. Download and install R from https://cran.r-project.org.
2. Download and install RStudio (an IDE for R) from
https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/.
3. Launch RStudio.
4. Install core libraries:
~~~
### PROGRAM:
~~~
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
install.packages("tidyverse")
print("R tools installed and loaded successfully.")
 #R INSTALLATION TEST
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("dplyr")
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
print("Hello, R is successfully installed!")
~~~
### C. Installing Tableau Public
~~~
1. Go to https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/.
2. Download Tableau Public and install it.
3. Create a free Tableau account and sign in.
4. Open Tableau → Load a sample dataset → Drag and drop fields to create a chart.
~~~
### D. Installing Microsoft Power BI
~~~
1. Visit https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/.
2. Download and install Power BI Desktop.
3. Launch Power BI and import any sample Excel/CSV data.
4. Create a basic bar chart or line chart.
~~~
### EXPECTED OUTPUT:
~~~
A.Python Installation
Pandas version: 1.5.3
Numpy version: 1.24.3
Matplotlib version: 3.7.1
Python successfully installed.
B. R Installation
[1] "Hello, R is successfully installed!"
C. Tableau Public / Power BI
● Successful launch of the software.
● Ability to import datasets (e.g., Excel, CSV).
● Display of sample charts or dashboards using drag-and-drop interface.
RESULT:
The following data analysis and visualization tools were successfully installed and verified:
● Python (Jupyter Notebook with Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
● R (RStudio with ggplot2 and dplyr)
● Tableau Public
● Microsoft Power B
